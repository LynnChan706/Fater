All Empty block buffers are still in the data receiver and ready for receiving. 2) The data receiver goes back to the pre stream start status.sThis parameter allows the data receiver to better handle the cases where the data receiver receives no packets for a long time due to a connection loss or a large number of packets are dropped on the network. Without this parameter, the data receiver may not be able to recover quickly as it may try to request many packets resends. sThis parameter also can help the data receiver work properly in the situation that the application is only a data receiver and the transmitter resets the block_id. For example, the transmitter transmitted the block_id n and data receiver received it. Then data receiver is excepting block_id n+1 but if the transmitter resets the block_id to 1. Without this parameter to reset it back to the pre stream start status the data receiver will ignore the new coming in blocks until it receives block_id n+1. For some transmitter devices, acquisition stop and start resets the block_id to 1.
